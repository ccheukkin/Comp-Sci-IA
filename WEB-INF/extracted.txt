SECTION B

Answer all questions.

12.     Harry is Tired (T) depending on the following three variables:
•  Work (W)
•  Hunger (H)
•  Sun (S).


Harry is tired if:
•   he works and he is hungry
•   he works and it is not sunny
•   he does not work and is not hungry.
(a)     Represent, as a single logical expression, the conditions that cause Harry to be tired.           [3] (b)       Construct the truth table to show when Harry is tired.                                                            [4] A professor  notices  that students  are  generally very  tired  and  decides  to  investigate the
relationship of tiredness with Work, Hunger and Sun.


Consider the following truth table which shows the conditions for Tired based on Work,
Hunger and Sun.


W       H       S       T
0       0       0       0
0       0       1       0
0       1       0       1
0       1       1       0
1       0       0       0
1       0       1       0
1       1       0       1
1       1       1       1

(Question 12 continued)

The conditions for one of the students to be tired can be expressed in the following array,
TIRED, where the index is equivalent to the combination of W, H and S in the truth table.


TIRED

[0]     [1]     [2]     [3]     [4]     [5]     [6]     [7]
0       0       1       0       0       0       1       1


(c)     Identify a relationship between the value of S and the index of the array TIRED.        [1]
        (d)             Construct an algorithm, TEST, in pseudocode, to output the conditions W, H and S from   the array TIRED for a student who is tired.                     [4]


A collection, STUDENT, is used to hold the name and the array TIRED for each student.


(e)    Outline the way in which your algorithm could be used to output the names of all those
students who are tired due to Work and Hunger.  [3]



13.     An  international  organization  has  offices located  across  several  countries.    For  some  of its activities, for example human resource management, it has been decided to adopt a “Software-as-a-Service” (SaaS) solution in order to keep the running costs low.
(a)     Describe the features of SaaS.                                                                                                 [3] (b) Discuss the limitations of SaaS in relation to security.                                                            [6] Each office makes some data available to external customers through the use of an extranet
and allows employees to work from home through a VPN.


(c)     Define the term extranet.                                                                                                         [2]


(d)    Distinguish between a VPN and an extranet.                                                                           [4]


14.     The faceplate of a car stereo has six buttons for selecting one of six preferred radio stations.
As part of the internal representation of a microprocessor there is an array with six positions,
carrying the information about the radio frequencies, as follows.


Radio

[0]     [1]     [2]     [3]     [4]     [5]
100.4   88.7    90.2    104.5   93.8    106.2



(a)     State the information at Radio[2].              [1]
        (b)             Outline how a numerical frequency could be stored in a fixed-length string.                     [2]
        (c)             Construct  an  algorithm,  in  pseudocode,  that  calculates  the  range  of (ie the difference between the highest and lowest frequencies) of any set of radio stations.               frequencies six selected                                        [6]


A display in the faceplate shows the name and frequency of the selected radio station. The name
is automatically captured when storing a preference.


(d)     Outline how a collection of objects could be used to store the name and frequency data in
the radio.      [2]


(e)     Construct an algorithm, in pseudocode, to access and display the name and frequency of
a station when a button is pressed.     [4]
