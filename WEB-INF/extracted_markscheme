General Marking Instructions

1.      Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.      Make sure that the question you are about to mark is highlighted in the mark panel on the right-hand side of the screen.

3.      Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point where it becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each mark awarded.

4.      Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark.  In these cases use Scoris™ annotations to support your decision.  You are encouraged to write comments where it helps clarity, especially for re-marking purposes.   Use a text box for these additional comments. It should be remembered that the script may be returned to the candidate.

5.      Personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

6.      Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks but the candidate has attempted the part question, enter a zero in the mark panel on the right-hand side of the screen. Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks because the candidate has not attempted the part question, enter an “NR” in the mark panel on the right-hand side of the screen.

7.      Ensure that you have viewed every page including any additional sheets.  Please ensure that you stamp ‘SEEN’ on any page that contains no other annotation.

8.      A mark should not be awarded where there is contradiction within an answer.  Make a comment to this effect using a text box or the “CON” stamp.

Subject Details:        Computer Science SL Paper 1 Markscheme

Mark Allocation

Section A: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 25 marks. Section B:  Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 45 marks.
Maximum total = 70 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows.  This is intentional. Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the following points:

       Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semi-colon (;).

       An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can be accepted.

       Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

       If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the same as that in the markscheme then award the mark.

       Mark positively.  Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have got wrong.

       Remember  that  many  candidates  are  writing  in  a  second  language;  be  forgiving  of minor linguistic slips.   In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

       Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for subsequent parts.  If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized.  However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this with “FT”.


General guidance

Issue   Guidance
Answering       more than the quantity of responses prescribed  in the questions        • In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks. Disregard incorrect answers.      • In  the  case  of  a  “describe” question,  which  asks  for  a  certain  number of  facts eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers.  This could include two descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications. • In  the  case  of  an  “explain”  question,  which  asks  for  a  specified  number  of explanations  eg  “explain  two  reasons  …”,  mark  the  first  two  correct  answers. This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial explanation etc.

                If the observations are made by only one person, they may be biased;
                Observations may be unreliable;
